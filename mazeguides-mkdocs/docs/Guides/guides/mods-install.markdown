# How to install mods

> Guide By Maze

---

## Step 1: Find a mod to install
The first thing you do is go to [https://www.nexusmods.com/](https://www.nexusmods.com/) and find a mod you want to install. 

The first mod you should install is the mod fixer: It will go down in overrides, and not to the right as shown below which is normal:
[https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/141](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/141)

---

## Step 2: Downloading the mod

!!! tip
    You might get confused into clicking on `Mod Manager Download`, but that is only for Vortex users and not BG3MM users

Select `MANUAL DOWNLOAD`

![Manual Download Button](/assets/mods-install/image3.png){ loading=lazy }

Then select `SLOW DOWNLOAD` (Unless you are a premium user)

!!! note
    You will need a Nexus Mods account to download mods, if you do not have one, make one

## Step 3: Extract the mod

The mod will likely come in either a `zip` or a `rar` file. Use 7zip or Winrar. (I personally recommend 7zip, its a better choice and is overall safer)

![Downloaded Mod archive](/assets/mods-install/image24.png){ loading=lazy }

After downloading the mod, extract the mod as shown

![Extracted Mod Files](/assets/mods-install/image20.png){ loading=lazy }

Then you can delete the `zip` or `rar` file

---

## Step 4: Open Mods Folder

Now you need to find your appdata mods folder.
The path is: `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods`

If you do not know how to find your Appdata mods folder, you can press the Windows key + r, and in the dialog that comes up, type in `%LOCALAPPDATA%` and select ok.

![Windows Run Dialog](/assets/mods-install/image9.png){ loading=lazy }

It will then open a file browser window in this folder:

![App Data Local Folder](/assets/mods-install/image12.png){ loading=lazy }

Now scroll down until you find `Larian Studios` and then click on that

Then find the folder `Baldurâ€™s Gate 3`

Then find the folder `Mods`

---

## Step 5: Copy mod to mods folder

Now you need to put the `.pak` file into your mods folder.

!!! tip
    DO NOT PUT ANYTHING ELSE IN THE MODS FOLDER: NO folders. NO `.json` files. NO zip/rar files. ONLY `.pak` files.

Just drag the .pak file into your mods folder, so it looks like this: 

![Mod pak in the mods folder](/assets/mods-install/image13.png){ loading=lazy }

---

## Step 6: Enable mod in BG3MM

Now you need to open BG3MM

Press the refresh button

![Refresh button in BG3MM](/assets/mods-install/image4.png){ loading=lazy }

After you have pressed the refresh button, it should look like this:

![BG3MM UI with one mod inactive](/assets/mods-install/image15.png){ loading=lazy }

As you can see the mod will be on the inactive side. 

Click on the mod, hold down and drag it over to the other side (the active side) so it looks like this:

![BG3MM UI with one mod active](/assets/mods-install/image30.png){ loading=lazy }

Now you just need to press `Save order` or `Export order`

![Save order button](/assets/mods-install/image21.png){ loading=lazy }

OR

![Export order button](/assets/mods-install/image28.png){ loading=lazy }

!!! tip
    
    They will do the same thing so no need to press both

If it works, you should see this message in the bottom of your Mod Manager: 

![Saved order message in BG3MM](/assets/mods-install/image11.png){ loading=lazy }

If it does not work, please ask me in Discord!

!!! tip
    
    Some mods will always be in overrides section in BG3MM! These include Mod Fixer, Improved Ui and others.

### Mod fixer is a must! Mod fixer is required because of this:
Mod fixer is a story compiler, which forces the game to compile the story. What does this mean? It means that it forces the game to be able to handle external .paks Without it, you can have issues such as: not being able to fast travel, not being able to interact with anybody and instead of character creation experience a naked durge haram.

**These are fine and should stay there. They are always active and the only way to deactivate them is to remove them from your mods folder!**
