Then delete `Dwrite.dll` from your bin folder

Delete `ScriptExtenderSettings.json` and `ScriptExtenderUpdater.json` if you have those as well

Then find the `BG3ScriptExtender` folder in your LocalAppdata folder

!!! tip
    To go to your appdata folder, press the Windows Key + R and then type `%localappdata%`

Now delete the folder named `BG3ScriptExtender`

!!! warning
    Make sure to only delete the `BG3ScriptExtender` folder.

Now go to your `Larian Studios` folder, then `Baldur's Gate 3`: Delete the `Script Extender` folder you have in there (if you have it)

!!! warning
    Make sure to only delete the `Script Extender` folder

Then run the game once, and then close the game

Then redownload SE. 
You can redownload via BG3MM (Tools, then extract and download Script extender) and then run the game once as Script Extender updates/installs on launch

Or you can download the script extender via github. Drop the Dwrite.dll in your bin folder and open the game once. 

!!! danger
    DO NOT GET THE SCRIPT EXTENDER FROM NEXUS!! THE NEXUS ONE IS NOT UPLOADED BY NORBYTE AND IT'S A PERSON WHO TRIED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NORBYTE BY ENABLING DP (A FORM OF NEXUS MONEY!!!)
