!!! tip
    Make sure you have file name extensions on, because this will not work if you do not have it on.

## Step 1: Download the makeup/tattoo/body tattoo you wish to use

Some mod authors have pre-made compatible files for Unique Tav for face and make up. `Mari’s tattoo/makeup collections` has it pre-made for example.

For mods that have pre-made files, you just need to download the file containing `Unique Tav` in their name. For example:

![Nexus Mods download page](/assets/unique-tav/2024-03-04 14.23.56.png){ loading=lazy }

You will then need to extract the `zip` file.

![Extract All highlighted in File Explorer right click menu](/assets/unique-tav/2024-03-04 14.24.53.png){ loading=lazy }

Then you open the folder:

![File Explorer window](/assets/unique-tav/2024-03-04 14.25.46.png){ loading=lazy }

You will see a folder named `Generated`. Move this folder to your Baldur's Gate 3 data folder. It will merge the new contents of the folder with the current contents.

!!! tip

    You may get a prompt to replace files, this is ok, and you should click on `Replace the file in the destination`.

    ![Replace files prompt](/assets/unique-tav/2024-03-04 14.27.58.png){ loading=lazy }

This should work for most mods, but some mods like `CovenElf Makeup/tattoo collection` and `Boring Tieflings` are not compatible with Unique Tav, and you will need to convert it.
