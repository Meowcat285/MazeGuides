# How To Install Baldur’s Gate 3 Mod Manager
> Guide By Maze

!!! note
    
    This guide is meant for Baldur’s Gate 3 Mod Manager users - not vortex. 
    
    I personally do not use Vortex and therefore it is not with them in mind. I might make one in the future!

## Step 1: Install Baldur’s Gate 3 Mod Manager
The first thing you gotta do is install Baldur’s Gate 3 Mod Manager. 

Grab it here: [https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager)

To grab the latest version, scroll down to “Setup” and press `Grab the latest release`

It will then download a zip file

---

## Step 2: Extract The ZIP file
Extract the zip file so it looks like this:

## Step 3: Move the folder

Now you need to move the folder somewhere. It doesn't matter where it is **as long it's not in a game folder. So do NOT place it in a larian or Baldur’s Gate 3 folder!**

This means you can have it on your hard drive, on another drive or simply just your desktop. Personally I have it in my desktop like this: 
![Image of the BG3MM files on a desktop](/assets/bg3mm-install/image2.png){ loading=lazy }

As you can see the BG3MM folder is just sitting there. *Do NOT remove the exe/app from the folder. Let it sit with the rest of the stuff in there - it’s important for it to work correctly.*

---

## Step 4: Open BG3MM
Now we need to set up BG3MM. Open the folder and click on `BG3ModManager`

![A file browser with BG3ModManager selected](/assets/bg3mm-install/image4.png){ loading=lazy }

It should look like this:

![BG3MM Main Interface](/assets/bg3mm-install/image11.png){ loading=lazy }

---

## Step 5: Verify Profile Selection

You need to check if your profiles are correct. They can be found in the bar at the top to the left.

![BG3MM Profile Selection](/assets/bg3mm-install/image10.png){ loading=lazy }

They should look like this. 
```
Profile: Public 
Mod Order: Current
```

!!! tip
    If they are blank, open the game to the main menu and close it down. It should correct itself

Now you need to go into your settings, then preferences: 

![Settings drop-down in BG3MM](/assets/bg3mm-install/image3.png){ loading=lazy }

![BG3MM Preferences](/assets/bg3mm-install/image6.png){ loading=lazy }

!!! tip
    
    The preferences should look like this.
    Your game data path has to end with your data folder and your game executable path has to end with your bg3.exe.

### If you do not know where they are, do this:
![Right click drop down of BG3 in Steam](/assets/bg3mm-install/image1.png){ loading=lazy }

![File browser window containing BG3 Files](/assets/bg3mm-install/image7.png){ loading=lazy }

It will take you to your games root folder which has both the bin and data folder.

Path (could be different depending on system and harddrive):
`D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3`

## Now that you have finished installing BG3MM, you can continue on to the mods install guide
