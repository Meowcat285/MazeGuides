# Proposed General Load Order

> Guide by Nells

---

Proposing a general Load Order structure, even though it doesn't matter a ton, but just as an easy guideline for people to set theirs up with. 

[I’ve been playing through with this load order](/assets/load-order/ryLULmR.png) (ignore the warnings icons on there, they indicate BG3MM not seeing SE, but I have SE installed and working manually), and it’s been reliable through at least half of Act 1, still testing it as I go through a playthrough. 

The structure behind it is as follows:

---

### ***DO NOT LOAD***
 - Honour.pak
 - DiceSet_06.pak

---

### **Load these things first**
 - Libraries such as 5eSpells, UnlockLevelCurve, CommunityLibrary, VladsGrimoire
 - Single-purpose SE mods (ex. Loz's Autosaver mods, KvCampEvents)

--- 

### **Load these things second**
 - Mods that provide playable actions, items, and dyes
 - Mods that fix base-game content and/or affect general gameplay (ex. Concentration Failsafe, Shields Overhaul)

---

### **Load these things third**
 - Mods provide new content to existing structures (ex. FeatsExtra, Metamagic Extended, WildMagicD100)

---

### **Load these things next, organized by type**
1. Additional Feats
2. Additional Races/Subraces
3. Additional Classes
4. Additional Subclasses (organized by main class)

---

### **Load these things next, organized by type**
1. Skin/Hair/Eye Color mods
2. Custom Hairs
3. Custom Cosmetics
4. Custom Heads
5. Custom Dice

---

### **Load these things last**
 - Mods that consist only of Compatibility Framework insertions (so the Feat Every 2/3 levels - Compatibility Framework version, for example)
 - Major patch mods (ex. Patches for CC Races, Spell List Combiner, Compatibility Framework)
 - Compatibility Framework is last to load
> Note: Minor patches should go closer to their primary mods - like the WarlockUndead5eSpells patch should go next to WarlockUndead
