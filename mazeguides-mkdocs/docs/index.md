## PSA! Do **NOT** use the version of Script Extender on Nexus!

Nexus Script Extender is not uploaded by Norbyte and has some settings turned off by default! This can cause issues! The person who uploaded Script Extender to Nexus, only did so to gain the DP (Donation Points) from it. Those are nexus currency and can be used to transfer to real money. They have turned it off now, but only by pressure from both members and Nexus Moderation team! The Nexus Script Extender is not supported in most Discord communities!
