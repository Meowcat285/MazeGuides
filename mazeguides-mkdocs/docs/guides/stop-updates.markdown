# How to stop steam from updating BG3 - useful when you mod the game and a patch is coming

> Guide By Maze

---

When you mod BG3, after every patch - expect some mods to break

!!! note
    
    If you have native mod loader -> reinstall it. It can get overwritten after a patch

### The following mods will probably break:
 - Script Extender (SE)
 - UI mods (Such as Improved UI and Plus UI)
 - Native mods (Such as Native Camera Tweaks and WASD Character Movement)

!!! note

    Native Mods may be able to be fixed by re-downloading Native Mod Loader as it can be overwritten when the game gets patched

## How to have steam active and run BG3 through BG3MM:

Right click on BG3 and choose properties 

![Image of BG3 right click menu in steam](/assets/stop-updates/image3.png)

This will come up, now click on `Updates`

![Image on BG3 properties window in steam](/assets/stop-updates/image7.png)

Set it to `Only update this game when I launch it`

## BG3MM Configuration

Click on `settings`, then `preferences`

![BG3MM Settings Dropdown](/assets/stop-updates/image4.png)

Make sure `Launch Through Steam` is unchecked

![BG3MM Preferences Menu](/assets/stop-updates/image5.png)

You may also have to have `skip launcher` checked so you do not open via launcher

!!! tip

    Make sure that when you open the launcher if you are on Vulkan or DirectX11 - if you use DirectX11, click the “Enable DirectX 11 Mode” -> if you use Vulkan, then you do not need to do anything. BG3MM defaults to Vulkan

Now you can just click here in BG3MM:

!!! tip

    Make sure to close Steam before you launch

And it will launch the game, and your game should not be updating when you launch it because it does not launch through steam.

## Second Method

!!! tip
    
    Make sure to set BG3 to update on launch, so it does not automatically start downloading the patch (so follow first steps above)

Otherwise, just go offline on steam and launch normally
