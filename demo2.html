<h1>How to establish a baseline for troubleshooting or go back to unmodded (you can mod your game again)</h1>
<p>First, this guide is meant as a reference to walk you through resetting your modsetting file, in addition it will help get you to a point where you can test if you have additional issues with mod incompatibilities. Like it or not, this is a vital step in helping ensure the problem is found through careful elimination.
Most issues often get fixed with this turn it on/off solution.</p>
<p>Keep in mind with these photos I have mods, some of these you may see different folders/files that are not commonly shared - completely fine, I will point out which ones you need to delete and what NOT to delete.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Deleting All mods in the Appdata/Mods folder</h2>
<p><strong>Please, keep in mind the location visible should be similar, this isn’t your installation folder</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, you can choose to move them out in a temporary folder, if you plan on keeping your mods. All the mods should be in the format of .pak 
Here is how to find the mods folder:</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Delete your entire Larian or BG3 folder, your saves are fine.
just navigate &amp; delete the pak files inside mods folder itself.(Even full reinstalls don’t need this)</strong></p>
<p>C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods
<img alt="Image of mods folder" src="image7.png" /></p>
<p>If you do not know how to find your AppData folder, here's how:
<img alt="Image Of Run in Windows Search" src="image9.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Image of Run dialog with %LOCALAPPDATA% in the text box" src="image8.png" /></p>
<p>Just go to the windows search function at the start, type ‘Run’ and click on it. In that app, type %LOCALAPPDATA% and press okay. Your appdata folder should be opened in file explorer. </p>
<h2>Step 2: Delete specified folders</h2>
<p><strong>Delete all folders except Localization. Photo for reference. Localization is vanilla.
You should only delete folders here, leave the pak files alone.</strong></p>
<p>The path should look something like this, depending on the drive you installed Baldurs Gate on: 
<code>D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3\Data</code></p>
<p><img alt="Image OF Data Folder" src="image1.png" /></p>
<p>Again do not delete the .pak files. Leave the .pak files and other files alone. Only delete the folders INSIDE of data. <strong>This means localization and the other .pak files is the only thing you see inside of /data once done.</strong> If you delete anything besides what is described here - your game is going to have to be reinstalled almost from scratch.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Clear Out All Folders in /bin folder</h2>
<p>The pathway should look like this: <code>D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3\bin</code></p>
<p>If you have native mod loader OR script extender, do these extra steps:</p>
<p><em>Inside your game's bin folder:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Delete <code>NativeMods</code> folder.</li>
<li>Delete <code>Dwrite.dll</code>. (This is the Script Extender)</li>
<li>Delete <code>bind2w64.dll</code></li>
<li>Rename <code>bink2w64_original.dll</code> to <code>bink2w64.dll</code></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MAKE SURE YOU HAVE DONE THE ABOVE</strong></p>
<h3>Step 3.5: If you have Party Limit Begone Legacy installed (the one that does not use Script Extender)</h3>
<hr />
<p>If you have <strong>Party Limit Begone Legacy</strong> installed, then you will need to delete your <code>exe</code> files in your bin folder. Delete the backup too</p>
<p><strong>The exes do not get altered/reinstalled when you verify the game so this is a MUST! if you had Party limit begone mod legacy. If you use the .pak version then do not worry and skip this step!</strong></p>
<h2>Step 4: Delete <code>modsettings.lsx</code> File</h2>
<p>You can find <code>modsettings.lsx</code> in <code>C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\PlayerProfiles\Public</code></p>
<p>Delete the highlighted <code>modsettings.lsx</code> file
<img alt="Image Of The modsettings.lsx file highlighed in the file browser" src="image3.png" /></p>
<h2>Step 5: Verify Game Files</h2>
<h3>If you are using BG3 on Steam:</h3>
<p>Go to your steam library and right click on Baldur's Gate 3</p>
<p><img alt="Image of the right click menu on steam with Properties selected" src="image2.png" /></p>
<p>Click on <code>Properties</code> as shown above</p>
<p><img alt="Image of Steam Properties Window" src="image6.png" /></p>
<p>This menu will appear - click on <code>Installed Files</code> and then on <code>Verify integrity of game files</code></p>
<p>Now you just wait until it is done
Do not worry if a lot files needs to be replaced - if you have loose file mods, these will likely need to be replaced</p>
<h3>If you are using GOG Galaxy</h3>
<p><img alt="Image of GOG Galaxy" src="image4.png" /></p>
<p>The picture is not in english but the option is highlighted. I will see if I can find an english version as I do not use GOG but nevertheless thank you Nerogami for the picture.</p>
<h2>Step 6: Run Baldur's Gate 3 once without any mods to reset the <code>modsettings.lsx</code> file</h2>
<p>Test if you can reach character creation without issues, look around for bugs, if none quickly make a base tav &amp; test if tutorial loads fine. If so you’re good to mod or play vanilla </p>
