# How to install manual/loose mods

This is a question I often get on discord, so it will have a page of its own

## Step 1


All mods that do NOT come in .pak form goes into the game directory. 

It will depend on the mod if it has to go inside the Data folder:

`D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3\Data`

Or the Bin folder:

`D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3\bin`

Or the root game folder:

`D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3`

I choose to download a tattoo/make up mod. It will come in a .rar file

Extract the zip/rar file:

As you can see - a folder called “Generated” will be extracted. This particular mod needs to go into my Data folder (if you are unsure where it goes, please read the mod description, it will say which folder it goes into)

So find your data folder, then drag the file into the Data folder - like this:
![Image of game Data folder](/assets/mods-install/image32.png)

That’s it! Now it’s installed.

If the file extracted from the rar/zip file is called Bin/Data it needs to go to the root folder: D:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Baldurs Gate 3

**It will auto merge with the already existing folder**

Some mods are installed differently such as Native mods & Party Limit Begone has other ways of installing. Refer to the mods description and the guides shown there.
