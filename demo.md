# How to establish a baseline for troubleshooting or go back to unmodded (you can mod your game again)

First, this guide is meant as a reference to walk you through resetting your modsetting file, in addition it will help get you to a point where you can test if you have additional issues with mod incompatibilities. Like it or not, this is a vital step in helping ensure the problem is found through careful elimination.
Most issues often get fixed with this turn it on/off solution.

Keep in mind with these photos I have mods, some of these you may see different folders/files that are not commonly shared - completely fine, I will point out which ones you need to delete and what NOT to delete.

> Step 1: Deleting All mods in the Appdata/Mods folder

**Please, keep in mind the location visible should be similar, this isn’t your installation folder**

Additionally, you can choose to move them out in a temporary folder, if you plan on keeping your mods. All the mods should be in the format of .pak 
Here is how to find the mods folder:

**Do Not Delete your entire Larian or BG3 folder, your saves are fine.
just navigate & delete the pak files inside mods folder itself.(Even full reinstalls don’t need this)**

C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\Mods
